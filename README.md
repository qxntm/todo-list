## What does the project do?

This is a project for learning, practice ,and understanding Redux Architecture by implementing a `Todo-List` by using Redux and Javascript along with the styled components.

What is the function of it?
```
- add new task
- delete the task
- toggle to complete/toggle to uncomplete
- use local storage to store the list of task and also its status
- the completed task will rearrange to the bottom of the list.
```

Future Improvement:
```
- switch from styled components to Tailwind.css.
- be able to makes notes for every tasks.
- be able to toggle view of completed task and uncomplete ones.
- styles the checkbox.
```


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
